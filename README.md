# Icarus-2

__This mod is outdated and will very soon be replaced by the fabric version__

Adds 1.11+ fireworks to 1.7.10 and 1.8.9 Icarus, and gives the player a stack of fireworks and an elytra upon creating the world. This is the official mod for Pre1.9 Icarus on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/mc_dmce). Both versions of the mod require the corresponding version of the [Backlytra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/backlytra) mod.

This is an unofficial fork of Duncan's [Icarus Old](https://github.com/DuncanRuns/Icarus-Old) mod.
